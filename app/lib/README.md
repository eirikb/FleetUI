This folder contains what seems to be the bare minimum of .jar-files required to run Noria.  
The files are copied from Fleet install directory, but can also be found online,
e.g., https://plugins.jetbrains.com/files/fleet/SHIP/1.10.192/modules/fleet.noria.ui-1.10.192.jar .

app.jar is slightly modified to make it smaller (from 400MB to 16MB).

Noria is at the moment closed source, but the jar files work just fine.
